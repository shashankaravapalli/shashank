	<p>For our second project, my group made a Halloween Fruit Ninja. In this game, you use the mouse to click on the fruit, there is a 60s timer and there are bombs which can kill the person and end the game, also the score of how many fruits are kept </p>

	<h2> Scratch Project</h2>

		<p> In this project, we analyzed a simulation model based on the natural selection of peppered moths, specifically in Manchester, from NetLogo.

We first identified the turtles, the patches, and the randomness used in the code to determine what and how the program is simulating the real-world system.
Afterward, we applied our understanding by analyzing the program exclusions, brainstormed how to improve the simulation, and real-world issues related to the model. </p>

<p>Due to the data collected, we have concluded that the rover is in the desert plains. We saw that the temperature was rising quickly during the day time which made us think it was in the rocky mountains however the sound data wasn’t as low as the sounds in the mountains are expected to be so because of the sound we chose the Desert plains.</p>
